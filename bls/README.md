This library depends on `numpy` and `py_ecc`. You can install it with 

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

You can also manually install the dependencies.

The `finitefield` module is taken from `https://github.com/initc3/babySNARK`
You can look at the original repository for examples on how to use it.
